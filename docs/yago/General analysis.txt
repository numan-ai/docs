YAGO is a centrally controlled large general-purpose knowledge base. Due to such control, the data's quality has some guarantees.

YAGO gets its data from wikidata following a custom version of schema.org's ontology

YAGO targets the reasoning formalism OWL DL

top-level taxonomy: Perfect, formal, basic.
lower-level taxonomy: Less formal, easy to read, big

YAGO doesn't appear to have any patterns like we do. What it has is its taxonomy, a hierarchical organization from general to specific.

YAGO however, has also tried to solve some ambiguity-related issues, they said they used a dataset called "BLINK".

Taxonomy:
        ...]-> (a) -[is a]-> (b) -[...
        where a and b are classes, so we have subclasses, each more specific than the other
        (a) -[property]-> (b)
        that's how properties are dealt with in YAGO

SPARQL API: https://yago-knowledge.org/sparql
        YAGO has an API so you can use the database w/o downloading it, however, it's capped to 1 minute per usage, if you plan on using it quicker. You'll have to download it.
